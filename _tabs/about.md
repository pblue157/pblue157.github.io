Just like any engineer in the Bay Area, I love drinking coffee and coding!

I’ve been in this industry for over 8 years, helping ensure devices are bug-free by the time they reach users' hands. Throughout my career, I’ve worked on many fascinating projects, and I’m always excited to hunt for bugs and assist companies in building solid automation frameworks to speed up the testing process.

## My Hobbies

This is my new hobby! I never imagined myself creating blog posts, but here I am. While I’ve written numerous wiki articles within organizations, I had never written a public post—until now.  

So, what inspired me? While surfing **[NetworkChuck's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck)**, I found his content incredibly motivating, and that’s what pushed me to start blogging.

But this isn’t just a blog. I also aim to contribute useful tools on my **[GitHub](https://github.com/pblue157)** repo and share solutions that can help others in their projects and learning journeys.

When I’m not coding or blogging, I enjoy playing football (aka soccer) and building civilizations in *Age of Empires*.
