# Breaking UART's 1:1 Limit: A Socket Server Solution

In my previous jobs (and my current one), I’ve spent a lot of time testing devices that spit out data over UART. If you’ve ever worked with UART, you’ll know it’s simple, reliable... but painfully introverted. It only likes to talk to one client at a time.

Now, imagine trying to automate testing for something like OTA (Over-The-Air) updates, which already takes ages. Add UART’s 1:1 limitation, and you’re in for a long, frustrating day.

This is where a socket server steps in to save the day! Think of it as the mediator between your serial device and the rest of the world. It connects to the device just like any regular serial connection, but instead of keeping the data to itself, it shares it on a common port so others can join in on the conversation.

Want to read or write data? Just send your message to the server, and it will handle it for you. Best part? Multiple clients can read data simultaneously, and yes, writing data at the same time is possible too! It’s like a communication party where everyone gets to talk—and listen—without stepping on each other’s toes.

This setup is especially useful when you need to run multiple tests simultaneously, like validating different functionalities while some process is running on the device. Whether you're a tester managing lots of test cases or someone who enjoys making devices communicate, this tool can be a great help.

## What’s Next?
In this post, I’m not going to dive into what to do with the data coming out of this setup. That’s a story for another time. For now, let’s just focus on making UART less of a bottleneck and more of a team player.
